1) Why npm?
=> npm is a node package manager for the Node JavaScript platform. 
   It installs/downloads a package and it's dependencies.
   It is used to publish, discover, install, and develop node programs.
   "npm install -g"               -> used to install the latest version of npm and its dependencies globally.
   "npm init"                  -> to initailize a javascript or node js project.
   "npm scripts"               -> to display the commands used.
   "package.json"              -> it holds the important data about the particular project before publishing.
   ".json"                     -> stores simple data structures and objects in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format
   "package-lock.json"         -> default packages
   "npm install --production"  -> installing npm for production environment. 
   "npm install --development" -> installing npm for developing environment.
   "npm ci"                    -> it is used install the packages which is similar to npm instal / ci - continuous integration
   "npm audit"                 -> gives information to the user if there is any updates needed.
   "npm audit fix"             -> helps in updating the affected vulnerabilities automatically.
   "npm publish" / "npm ls"    -> to publish the packages installed 
   "npm list -g"               -> to know where the npm is installed globally in the system
   npm dependencies are the other packaeges which helps to work the existing pakages.

2) why npm -g , save-dev?
=> "npm -g" -> is used in installing a flag globally.

       "npm install --save [package-name]"      -> installs the package and updates the dependencies in the package.json file/existing file. 
       "npm install --save-dev [package-name]"  -> installs the package and updates the dependencies in the development environment       (devdependencies).

3) Why Yarn?
=> Yarn is also considered as a package manager for the code. 
   It allows us to use the code developed by other developers worldwide in our code.
   "npm install -g yarn"      -> helps to install the yarn package globally.
   "cd. ."                    -> helps in moving to the parent directory
   "yarn set version latest"  -> gets updated to the latest version of yarn release.
   "yarn set version from sources" / "yarn set version from sources --branch 121" -> used to fetch the latest commits made to yarn from git
   "yarn help"                -> displays list of commands used in yarn
   "yarn init"                -> initialising yarn to a particular folder/file.

   "yarn up"                  -> updating a package/dependencies.
   "yarn remove"              -> removes a particular package installed.

4) Express js? How to upgrade to new express js?
=> Express is a web framework for Node.js.
   
   npm install express --save            -> Helps in installing express in node terminal as a package and saving it in the dependencies.
   npm install express --no-save         -> temporarily installing and not saving in the dependencies/package.json
